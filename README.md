# Splurge Stopper
An [Amazon Alexa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Alexa) skill for
discouraging splurge purchases. You ask it why you shouldn't spend a certain
amount of money, and it responds with how much money you might have in the
future if you invest it instead.

> You: Hey Alexa, ask Splurge Stopper why I shouldn't spend 80 dollars on fancy
> socks.

> Alexa: Because if you invest it instead, you might have about 143 dollars in
> 10 years, 257 dollars in 20 years, 459 dollars in 30 years, or 823 dollars in
> 40 years.

It assumes an inflation-adjusted annualized return rate of 6 percent. The
historical rate for the S&P 500 is [between 6 and 7
percent](http://moneychimp.com/features/market_cagr.htm).

## Installation

## Caveats
1. [Past performance is no guarantee of future
   results](https://www.thebalance.com/past-performance-is-no-guarantee-of-future-results-357862).
   Losing money is a risk.
2. You have to actually invest the money that you don't spend. It's not enough
   to just not make the purchase.
3. You have to hold for the long term. The point of listing the amounts for
   multiple time periods is to show just how effective exponential growth can
   be when it works in your favor.
